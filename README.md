Barrett Model
=============

This repository contains a stripped down Barrett WAM CAD and URDF without any inertial or collision properties. The meshes and kinematics are based on publicly available resources from barrett.com and the package was forked from [here](https://github.com/jhu-lcsr/barrett_model).
